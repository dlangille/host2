# R720
Information about the server I'm selling.

I'm not sure if I will keep the SSDs or not.

I can sell the chassis separate from the drives.

At one time, the host was as described here: https://dan.langille.org/2019/11/08/r720-3/

* Dell R720 chassis with space for 16 2.5" drives
* SAS2308 for the drives
* SAS2008 which I am keeping
* 10G fiber card - keeping
* Memory 383248 MB (about 380GB)
* CPU – 2x CPU E5-2690 v2 @ 3.00GHz (2 package(s) x 10 core(s) x 2 hardware
threads)

It contains these drives, but I'm not sure I'll sell all these. - smartctl
informatio to be added later.

* 6 x 400GB SAS SSDs – data01 zpool
* 2 x 100GB SAS SSDs – unused – I think this is da0 and da1
* 2 x 80GB SATA SSDs – zroot zpool
* 4 x 500GB SATA SSDs – tank_fast zpool
* 1 x 250GB SATA SSD – unused – probably da10

FreeBSD installed now. I'll wipe the drives..

I'd prefer local pickup, because shipping is so much work....
